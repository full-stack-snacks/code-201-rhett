# LAB - 01

## About me

I built an HTML website that incorporates an external CSS stylesheet and external JavaScript code. The purpose of the site is to share with the user different things about me, such as my bio, education, and goals. It prompts to user to ask their name so that it can customize messages welcoming them to the site and saying goodbye. It also quizzes the user in five `Yes` or `No` questions. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well.

### Reflections and Comments

- Using the `reset.css` file that stripped the default browswer styling forced me to be more aware styling options and dig into customizing the page
- I learned first hand how specificity works in CSS when I was trying to find a bug for why an image wouldn't center, and it turned out it was getting direction from an element selector that conflicted with what I was trying to get it to do
